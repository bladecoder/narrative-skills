# Part 2: Weave

So far, we've been building branched stories in the simplest way, with "options" that link to "pages".

But this requires us to uniquely name every destination in the story, which can slow down writing and discourage minor branching.

**ink** has a much more powerful syntax available, designed for simplifying story flows which have an always-forwards direction (as most stories do, and most computer programs don't).

This format is called "weave", and its built out of the basic content/option syntax with two new features: the gather mark, `-`, and the nesting of choices and gathers.
